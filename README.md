# ChIP-seq
Codes including shell &amp; R scripts on the 2017 paper: The Drosophila speciation factor HMR localizes to genomic insulator sites

In this paper, we made a study on the genome-wide localization of HMR in D. melanogaster tissue culture cells, which suggest a novel link between HMR and insulator proteins that implicates a potential role for genome organization in the formation of species.

THe codes here were used for to make the analysis of the associated ChIP-seq which writen in shell and R. Data sources and figures including descriptions generated are provided.

The shell scripts were used for the ChIP data mapping and peak-calling while the R scripts for the in-depth analysis of ChIP-seq and figures. The software used in shell scripts including [bowtie2], [samtools], [bedtools], [macs] & [macs2]; [ChIPpeakAnno], [GenomicRanges], [VennDiagram], [Vennerable], [pheatmap], [BSgenome.Dmelanogaster.UCSC.dm3] and other base packages.
